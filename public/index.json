For example, ants are able to focus their foraging effort on the most rewarding food source. While this phenomenon is well known, the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected. Here we analysed the global dynamics of the food dissemination in Camponotus cruentatus workers, after feeding on a low (0.1M) or on a high (1M) sucrose concentration food source. We also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis. The results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration. We then discuss these results in the light of recent advances in the study of efficiency in food management in ants.","tags":null,"title":"Food dissemination in ants: Robustness of the trophallactic network against resource quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

We investigated how the interplay between the physical characteristics of the paths leading to food sources and the way it impacts the behaviour of individual ants affects their collective decisions.

Both food sources were discovered simultaneously, but the food source at the end of the straight path was preferentially exploited by ants.

Here, we explore the relationship between personality and social interactions to explain the speed and cohesion of collective decision making during the aggregation process of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana). We composed groups solely with shy individuals (spending a long time sheltered) or bold individuals (spending a short time sheltered) and tested them in a binary setup (arena with two shelters) for 3 consecutive days. We analysed the shelter use of individuals and groups to compare behavioural consistency among days and analyse the collective decision-making process. Contrary to the bold groups, shy groups had a faster aggregation process with more individuals sheltered mainly because shy individuals found the shelter more rapidly. Moreover, we show that personality is modulated by social interactions. We show high behavioural plasticity in bold groups, where some individuals act shy. This also suggests that learning and regulation mechanisms may take place. This study sheds some light on the implications of individual personality for collective decision making and the key role of shy individuals in gregarious species, such as P. americana.","tags":null,"title":"The interplay between personalities and social interactions affects the cohesion of the group and the speed of aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.-O.

They showed, for example, that attraction between individuals is at the origin of an amplification of individual preferences. These preferences may concern various environmental cues such as biomolecules that convey information about the environment such as vanillin, which, for some insects, is an attractant. In this study, we analysed how the social context of the cockroaches of the species Periplaneta americana modifies preferences when individuals are offered two shelters, of which one is vanillin scented. One of the principal results of our study is that isolated individuals stay longer and more frequently in a vanillin-scented shelter, while groups choose more frequently the unscented one. Moreover, the proportion of sheltered insects is larger when the group selects the unscented shelter. Our experimental results and theoretical model suggest that the individual preference is not inverted when insects are in a group but, rather, the response to vanillin decreases the attraction between individuals. As a result, aggregation is favoured in the unscented shelter, leading therefore to a collective inversion.","tags":null,"title":"Group choices seemingly at odds with individual preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Herein, we followed the aggregation process of two isopod species under monospecific and heterospecific conditions at three population densities. Our experimental results show that the formation of both the monospecific and heterospecific groups responds to a similar threshold function. Furthermore, the two species contribute equally to the mixed-species aggregate growth and are not spatiotemporally segregated. However, we show that the cohesion is weaker and the probability of forming aggregations is lower in heterospecific groups than in monospecific populations. Thus, our results show that amplification processes are shared between species, but that the weighting given to conspecific and heterospecific information differs. We develop a theoretical model to test this hypothesis. The model reproduces our experimental data and shows that a relatively low level of inter-attractions between species is able to generate mixed-species aggregates. Moreover the greater the total population, the lower this parameter value is needed to observe aggregation in both species. This highlights the importance to study not only qualitatively but also quantitatively the heterospecific interactions in mixed-species groups.

A key result is the possibility for sub-groups to segregate between patches and for transition between different patterns, even in absence of active agonistic behaviour.

We combined experiments and models to show that variability in cell signalling contributes to major differences in behaviour underpinning some aspects of social interactions. First, following thousands of cells under various contexts, we identified distinct behavioural phenotypes: ‘slow–regular–social’, ‘fast–regular–social’ and ‘fast–irregular–asocial’. Second, coupling chemical analysis and behavioural assays we found that calcium signalling is responsible for these behavioural phenotypes. Finally, we show that differences in signalling and behaviour led to alternative social strategies.

The second trap is in terms of cultural values, where countries with low levels of democracy and/or life expectancy fail to develop emancipative values.

When faced with foods varying in quality, ants are known to be able to select the best food source using pheromone trails. Until now, studies investigating collective decisions have focused on single nutrients, mostly carbohydrates. In the environment, the foods available are a complex mixture and are composed of various nutrients, available in different forms. In this paper, we explore the effect of protein to carbohydrate ratio on ants’ ability to detect and choose between foods with different protein characteristics (free amino acids or whole proteins). In a two-choice set up, Argentine ants Linepithema humile were presented with two artificial foods containing either whole protein or amino acids in two different dietary conditions: high protein food or high carbohydrate food. At the collective level, when ants were faced with high carbohydrate foods, they did not show a preference between free amino acids or whole proteins, while a preference for free amino acids emerged when choosing between high protein foods. At the individual level, the probability of feeding was higher for high carbohydrates food and for foods containing free amino acids. Two mathematical models were developed to evaluate the importance of feeding probability in collective food selection. A first model in which a forager deposits pheromone only after feeding, and a second model in which a forager always deposits pheromone, but with greater intensity after feeding. Both models were able to predict free amino acid selection, however the second one was better able to reproduce the experimental results suggesting that modulating trail strength according to feeding probability is likely the mechanism explaining amino acid preference at a collective level in Argentine ants.","tags":null,"title":"Collective choice in ants: the role of protein and carbohydrates ratios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

For example, ants are able to choose between food sources that vary in quality using a chemical trail. This communication system characterized by a strong positive feedback allows a rapid transfer of information and the selection of the best food source. This is true in static environment, where a single, unchanging solution exists. In dynamic environments however such recruitment often ‘lock’ groups into suboptimal decisions, preventing a response to changes in available resources. Here, we investigate decision-making in a dynamic environment for the greenhead ants (Rhytidoponera metallica) which use a non-chemical recruitment. To experimentally test our study species’ ability to adapt to changes in their foraging environment, we offered three feeders that changed in quality. At any given time, only one feeder provided high quality food, while the others provided low quality food. Every two hours, the quality of the feeders changed such that the previously high quality feeder became a low quality feeder, and vice versa. We showed that ants were able to track changes in food quality across space and time. By coupling behavioral observations to computer simulations, we demonstrate that selection of food sources relies uniquely on a retention effect of feeding individuals on newcomers without comparison between available opportunities. The elegance of these parsimonious foraging systems is that the collective decision arises from the perception of conspecifics without the need for a leader having a synoptic overall view of the situation and knowing all the available options.","tags":null,"title":"Flexibility in collective decision-making by ant colonies: Tracking food across space and time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

At the transition between quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes, activity cycles are asymmetrical, with rapid activity increases and slower decreases and a phase shift between external forcing and activity. We find similar activity patterns in ant colonies in response to varying temperature during the day. Thus foraging ants operate in a region of quasiperiodicity close to a cascade of transitions leading to chaos.

The response to pheromone was found to follow a Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990). However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.","tags":null,"title":"Individual rules for trail pattern formation in Argentine ants (Linepithema humile)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Ants and slime moulds are just two examples of a wide range of species and biological processes that use positive feedback mechanisms to reach decisions. Here we use a generic, experimentally validated model of positive feedback between group members to show that the probability of taking the best of  options depends crucially on the strength of feedback. We show how the probability of choosing the best option can be maximized by applying an optimal feedback strength. Importantly, this optimal value depends on the number of options, so that when we change the number of options the preference of the group changes, producing apparent “irrationalities”. We thus reinterpret the idea that collectives show \"rational\" or \"irrational\" preferences as being a necessary consequence of the use of positive feedback. We argue that positive feedback is a heuristic which often produces fast and accurate group decision-making, but is always susceptible to apparent irrationality when studied under particular experimental conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Collective irrationality and positive feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We establish that the ants' behavior is consistent with the use of two different pheromone signals, both of which recruit nestmates. Our experiments suggest that during exploration the ants deposit a long-lasting pheromone that elicits a weak recruitment of nestmates, while when exploiting food the ants deposit a shorter lasting pheromone eliciting a much stronger recruitment. We further investigate experimentally the role of these pheromones under both static and dynamic conditions and develop a mathematical model based on the hypothesis that exploration locally enhances exploitation, while exploitation locally suppresses exploration. The model and the experiments indicate that exploratory pheromone allows the colony to more quickly mobilize foragers when food is discovered. Furthermore, the combination of two pheromones allows colonies to track changing foraging conditions more effectively than would a single pheromone. In addition to the already known causes for the ecological success of invasive ant species, our study suggests that their opportunistic strategy of rapid food discovery and ability to react to changes in the environment may have strongly contributed to their dominance over native species.","tags":null,"title":"The role of multiple pheromones in food recruitment by ants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We offered groups of caterpillars a binary choice between two equal food sources, either containing a balanced ratio of protein and carbohydrate or lacking digestible carbohydrate. Individual caterpillars responded to the diet treatment by becoming either inactive or active. The existence of these two behavioural categories was evident under dietary imbalance but not when foods were nutritionally balanced. At a collective level, the individual differences in behaviour led to colony decisions that were dependent upon the ratio of the two behavioural categories present in the group. Colonies comprising a majority of active caterpillars (‘active biased’) were less cohesive than inactive-biased colonies. Under dietary imbalance, active-biased groups did not focus their activity on one food source but split and exploited two sources at the same time. Since both food sources were nutritionally unbalanced, these groups grow less well than inactive-biased groups that remained on one food source.

In our experiment, ants had to go from their nest to a food source by crossing a diamond-shaped bridge, giving the choice between two paths. Two types of bridges were used: the first had two branches of equal length but different width while the second had two branches of different length and width. Experiments at high traffic volume always ended up with the selection of the wider branch, even if it was longer. This result shows that overcrowding on the narrow branch plays an essential role in the mechanism underlying the choice of route in ants. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the importance of two mechanisms that could account for this result. The first is based on the difference in travel duration between the two paths. The second is based on the repulsive interactions between workers making head-on encounters. The model shows that travel duration per se is not sufficient to explain path choice. Rather, it is the interplay between trail following behaviour and repulsive interactions that allows ants to choose the path that minimizes their travel time. When choosing a path ants thus prefer to trade time against energy. Our results demonstrate that any environmental constraint that alters the dynamics of trail recruitment can lead to the emergence of adaptive foraging decisions without any explicit coding of information by the foragers at the individual level.","tags":null,"title":"Collective decisions in ants when foraging under crowded conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.-L.

It has been established that ants are able to optimize their foraging by selecting the most rewarding source. Our results not only confirm that selection is the result of a trail modulation according to food quality but also show the existence of an optimal quantity of laid pheromone for which the selection of a source is at the maximum, whatever the difference between the two sources might be. In terms of colony size, large colonies more easily focus their activity on one source. Moreover, the selection of the rich source is more efficient if many individuals lay small quantities of pheromone, instead of a small group of individuals laying a higher trail amount.

Both the case of identical environmental characteristics and the case where one source and the corresponding trail are different from the others are considered. Different collective responses depending on the environmental conditions, and without change of individual behaviour, are shown to exist, associated with the possibility that the colony may be led to exploit one source or a group of sources preferentially. The full bifurcation diagram of steady-state solutions is constructed from which the dominant exploitation patterns are identified. The biological relevance of the results is discussed and suggestions are made for their experimental testing in connection with the recruitment behavior of species using trail recruitment. The same phenomenological model can be used for different trail-laying species since the predictions are generic and not restricted to a given species, except for the parameter values used.","tags":null,"title":"Emerging patterns and food recruitment in ants: an analytical study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"        Parameters of the model  Number of individuals (\\(N\\))  Probability to join shelter 1 (\\(\\mu_1\\))  Probability to join shelter 2 (\\(\\mu_2\\))  Individual probability to leave shelter 1 (\\(\\theta_1\\))  Individual probability to leave shelter 2 (\\(\\theta_2\\))  Interattraction in shelter 1 (\\(\\alpha_1\\))  Interattraction in shelter 2 (\\(\\alpha_2\\))  Threshold value (\\(K\\))  Cooperativity (\\(m\\))    Parameters of the simulation  Number of timesteps  Number of simulations     Show plot Show stats Show data Download data   Binary choice cockroach model   $$\\frac{d X_i}{dt} = \\mu _i\\left(N - \\sum_{j=1}^2 X_j\\right) -\\frac{\\theta_i}{K^m+\\left(\\alpha_i X_i\\right)^m}X_i \\quad i=1,2$$    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6cfb72da34f45e33be040d41b150e9de","permalink":"/apps/binary-choice-js/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/apps/binary-choice-js/","section":"apps","summary":"        Parameters of the model  Number of individuals (\\(N\\))  Probability to join shelter 1 (\\(\\mu_1\\))  Probability to join shelter 2 (\\(\\mu_2\\))  Individual probability to leave shelter 1 (\\(\\theta_1\\))  Individual probability to leave shelter 2 (\\(\\theta_2\\))  Interattraction in shelter 1 (\\(\\alpha_1\\))  Interattraction in shelter 2 (\\(\\alpha_2\\))  Threshold value (\\(K\\))  Cooperativity (\\(m\\))    Parameters of the simulation  Number of timesteps  Number of simulations     Show plot Show stats Show data Download data   Binary choice cockroach model   $$\\frac{d X_i}{dt} = \\mu _i\\left(N - \\sum_{j=1}^2 X_j\\right) -\\frac{\\theta_i}{K^m+\\left(\\alpha_i X_i\\right)^m}X_i \\quad i=1,2$$    ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"apps"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"         Number of individuals :  Probability of success :  Calculate probability between and   Show plot     ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"edbf29a7b19f0efc3ab37b4a1e635d36","permalink":"/apps/binomial-js/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/apps/binomial-js/","section":"apps","summary":"         Number of individuals :  Probability of success :  Calculate probability between and   Show plot     ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"apps"}]
