abstract = "The propagation of extreme events in space is analyzed for a class of dynamical systems giving rise to spatiotemporal chaos. It is shown that this process can be mapped into a generalized random walk, whereby the mean square displacement increases linearly in time and there is a nonvanishing probability for jumps beyond first neighbors. The relative roles of the local dynamics and of the spatial coupling are identified."
