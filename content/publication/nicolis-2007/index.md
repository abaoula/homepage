abstract = "It is shown that deterministic dynamics leaves a clearcut signature on the statistical properties of the return time of extreme events, giving rise to properties that are not accounted for by the classical statistical approach. Analytical expressions are derived, compared to those of classical statistical theory and applied to generic examples of dynamical systems giving rise to quasi-periodic, strongly chaotic and intermittent chaotic behaviors."
