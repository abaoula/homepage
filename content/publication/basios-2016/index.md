abstract = "The study of the topic of guided aggregation in biology brings together decision making, collective motion and the dynamical interplay between individuals and groups. At the same time it meets statistical mechanics and the physics of complex systems in a new paradigmatic thinking. We propose a research platform for implementation and for undertaking systematic studies of coordinated aggregation, in a truly multi- and inter-disciplinary fashion."
