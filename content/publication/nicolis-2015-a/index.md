abstract = "We suggest that the main features of animal construction can be understood as the sum of locally independent actions of non-interacting individuals subjected to the global constraints imposed by the nascent structure. We first formulate an analytically tractable macroscopic description of construction which predicts a 1/3 power law for how the length of the structure grows with time. We further show how the power law is modified when biases in random walk performed by the constructors as well as halting times between consecutive construction steps are included."
