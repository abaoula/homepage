abstract = "A two-variable bistable system modeling the selection between competing options is considered in the presence of additive white noise, representing environmental or internal variability. It is shown that when the strengths of the noises acting on the evolution equations of the two variables are different a symmetry-breaking process takes place, whereby the state in which the excess variable is perturbed by the strongest noise becomes predominant."
