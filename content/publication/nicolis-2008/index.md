abstract = "Amplifying communications are a ubiquitous characteristic of group-living animals. This work is concerned with their role in the processes of food recruitment and resource exploitation by social insects. The collective choices made by ants faced with different food sources are analyzed using both a mean field description and a stochastic approach. Emphasis is placed on the possibility of optimizing the recruitment and exploitation strategies through an appropriate balance between individual variability, cooperative interactions and environmental constraints."
