abstract = "Direct contact between individuals is important for the organization of social insects. The question has been raised whether in ant colonies contact may also provide a mechanism to allow ants to estimate the density of the population in a nest and regulate their behaviour accordingly, as reflected by a subquadratic dependence of the number of interactions as a function of the density. We developed a kinetic model of encounters between individuals, and conducted an experiment with different densities of the species Lasius niger. These suggested that the subquadratic law is not due to active regulation by ants but arises, rather, as a consequence of the kinetics of the encounter process and the presence of small, temporary clusters of individuals."
