abstract = "We review and extend theoretical and empirical studies of how groups make decisions using combinations of private information and preference copying. We give six tested or testable predictions arising from models: (i) group decisions involve both true and false cascades; (ii) a small number of leaders can heavily influence a decision; (iii) individuals in groups make accurate and fast decisions; (iv) irrelevant alternatives change preferences; (v) optimal group size depends on the number of options; and (vi) pairs of higher quality options are more difficult to distinguish than lower quality options. We discuss our approach in the context of human organisations."
