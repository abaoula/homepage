abstract = "The feedback circuit approach to nonlinear dynamical systems pioneered by Thomas and coworkers is revisited in a thermodynamical perspective. The role of nonequilibrium conditions and of other types of constraints such as mass action kinetics or microscopic reversibility around thermodynamic equilibrium in the way positive feedback circuits are operating is analyzed. It is shown that the appearance of non-trivial steady-state and time-dependent behaviors necessitates that the strengths of the feedback loops present exceed some well-defined critical values. Illustrations are provided on prototypical systems giving rise to multiple steady states."
